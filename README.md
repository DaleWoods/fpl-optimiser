# FPL Optimiser

Single-user Fantasy Premier League optimiser: ingests the official FPL API, applies the
league rules as hard constraints, projects expected points per player, and recommends a
starting XI, captain, bench order and transfer — with a plain-English reason for each.

Built to the requirements in `docs/fpl-optimiser-spec.md`. Phase 1 (MVP) only.

## Status

| Step | Area | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project scaffold, config loading + validation | done |
| 2 | SQLite storage and migrations | done |
| 3 | FPL API client (throttled, cached, replayable) | done |
| 4 | Ingestion into storage + change detection | done |
| 4b | CLI, report page and Render blueprint | done |
| 5 | Availability classification | done |
| 6 | Rules engine (hard constraints) | done |
| 7 | Expected-points model | done |
| 8 | ILP optimiser: best XI, best squad, captain, bench | done |
| 9 | Single-transfer recommender | done |
| 10 | CLI + web report | done |

## Requirements

Node.js 22 or newer. No other runtime dependencies — SQLite and the LP solver are both
bundled as npm packages.

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Commands

```bash
npm run fpl -- ingest              # pull fresh data into local storage
npm run fpl -- ingest --summaries  # ...including per-player match history (slow)
npm run fpl -- status              # state of play: freshness, squad, flags, changes
npm run fpl -- optimise            # recommend the best team for the next gameweek
npm run fpl -- optimise --gw 1     # ...for a specific gameweek
npm run fpl -- optimise --scratch  # build a squad from scratch, ignoring the one loaded
npm run fpl -- serve               # serve the report at http://localhost:3000
npm run fpl -- help
```

`ingest --replay <dir>` reads recorded API payloads from a directory instead of calling the
FPL API — useful offline, and for reproducing a past recommendation exactly.

## Deploying to Render

`render.yaml` defines a single web service that serves the report, runs a background
ingestion on a schedule, and stores its database on a mounted disk.

**The disk is not optional.** Render's filesystem is wiped on every deploy and restart. This
app derives price trends, form trends and "what changed since last check" by comparing
snapshots stored over time — without persistence that history resets constantly and change
detection can never report anything, because there is never a previous snapshot to compare
against.

That has a cost implication: **a persistent disk requires a paid instance type.** Free
instances cannot mount one, and they also spin down when idle, which would stop the scheduled
ingestion. The blueprint therefore specifies `plan: starter`. Change it if you want a
different tier — but do not move it to `free`, because the disk will not attach.

Endpoints once deployed:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | The report page, with the "pick my best team" button |
| `/optimise` | The recommendation: XI, captain, bench, transfers |
| `/optimise.json` | The same, machine-readable |
| `/state.json` | The same data, machine-readable |
| `/healthz` | Health check — deliberately independent of the FPL API |
| `POST /ingest` | Trigger an ingestion immediately |

The health check does **not** depend on the FPL API being reachable. If it did, an FPL outage
would fail the health check and put the service into a restart loop.

### Running locally instead

Deployment is optional. The app is designed to run on your own machine, which costs nothing
and keeps full snapshot history:

```bash
npm install && npm run fpl -- ingest && npm run fpl -- status
```

The only thing you lose is always-on scheduled ingestion — you run `ingest` yourself before a
deadline, which is when freshness matters most anyway.

## Configuration

All rules and model weights live in `config/`, never in code:

- **`config/rules.json`** — the FPL ruleset as hard constraints: squad make-up, budget,
  max per club, formation bounds, transfer rollover and hit costs, chip rules, scoring.
- **`config/model.weights.json`** — every tunable number in the expected-points model,
  stamped with a `modelVersion` that is recorded against each stored projection.
- **`config/app.json`** — your team ID, API politeness settings, cache TTLs, database path.

To change anything locally without touching version control, copy a file to
`config/local.<name>.json` and override the top-level keys you care about. Those files are
gitignored.

### Setting your team ID

Find the number in your FPL URL — `fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/1234567/event/1` means
your team ID is `1234567` — and set it in `config/app.json`:

```json
{ "teamId": 1234567 }
```

Commands that need your squad fail with a clear message until this is set. Nothing is
guessed.

## What the public API cannot tell us

Three things the optimiser needs are not available without an authenticated session, so none
of them are guessed. Each is recorded with an explicit source, and any advice resting on them
says what it assumed:

| Value | Why it is missing | What we do |
|---|---|---|
| Free transfers | Only on the authenticated `my-team` endpoint | Derived from transfer history under the rollover rules, with the workings kept and any drift from the hits the API actually charged flagged as a caveat |
| Purchase / selling price | Not public at all | Left null with `price_source = 'unknown'`; the transfer engine declines to reason about budget rather than invent one |
| Live bank balance | Public API gives the value as at the last deadline | Used as stated, labelled as such |

Before the season's first deadline there is no squad to load at all — the picks endpoint has
nothing to return. That is handled as an expected state, not an error: manager state is still
recorded and a note explains why the squad is empty.

### Positions are never hardcoded

`config/rules.json` declares the *rules* for a position (how many in a squad, how many can
start). The live API declares which positions *exist*. On every run the two are reconciled,
and a mismatch — a renamed position, a new one, one the config has no rules for — stops the
run rather than quietly skewing a projection. The 2026/27 season reclassified 11 players, so
player positions are always read from the API, never assumed.

## Design notes

**Money is in tenths of a million**, as integers, matching the API's `now_cost` units. £100.0m
is `1000`. No floating-point money anywhere.

**Config is strict.** An unrecognised key in a config file is treated as a typo and fails the
load. A rules file where a mistake silently does nothing is the one failure mode this app
cannot afford. Human notes go in `$comment` keys, which are stripped before validation.

**The rules file validates against itself.** Position counts must sum to the squad size, the
XI and bench must add up, formation minimums must fit and maximums must fill, the bench
composition must follow from the squad and formation. A contradiction is caught at load time,
not discovered in a recommendation.
